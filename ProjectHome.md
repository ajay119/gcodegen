gcodegen is a python library and set of sample scripts to facilitate the production of gcode.

gcode is a simple language used to control CNC machinery.  The gcode produced here is tailored for use in 3D printers such as reprap or makerbot.  The emphasis is on controlling an extruder print-head that constructs a model, from bottom to top, in layers.
